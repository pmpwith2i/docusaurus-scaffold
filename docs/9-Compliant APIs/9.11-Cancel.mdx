# Cancel

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge class='small' type="post" /> P2PE/cancel](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/P2PE/cancel&branch=main&version=3.0.1)**: A call to the cancel endpoint sends a cancel command from the POS software to terminate any in-flight operations. If you use the cancel command to allow a merchant or cardholder to
attempt to cancel a transaction in progress, you should also use the CardPointe Gateway API's inquireByOrderid request to verify the status of the transaction. A transaction cannot be canceled if the terminal service has already initiated the authorization request to the CardPointe Gateway; however, you can use the inquireByOrderid request to check the status of the transaction and void if necessary
