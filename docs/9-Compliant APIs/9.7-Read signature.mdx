# Read Signature

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge class='small' type="post" /> P2PE/readSignature](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/P2PE/readSignature&branch=main&version=3.0.1)**: A call to the readSignature endpoint sends a prompt to the terminal to capture the cardholder's signature, which is then returned in the response. The readSignature endpoint is supported for terminal devices that support signature capture. See [Capturing and Handling Cardholder Signatures](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/CardPointe/docs/?path=docs/documentation/CardPointeIntegratedTerminalDeveloperGuides.md&branch=develop#capturing-and-handling-cardholder-signatures) for guidance on how and when to capture signatures.

:::warning[Warning]
The only time we recommend a signature requirement is for accepting Terms & Conditions.
