# Disconnect

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge class='small' type="post" /> P2PE/disconnect](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/P2PE/disconnect&branch=main&version=3.0.1)**: A call to the disconnect endpoint closes the session and releases the session key provided in the request header. The session key cannot be used in any subsequent requests; you must call the connect endpoint to retrieve a new session key. The disconnect command does not cancel an in-flight transaction. To terminate an in-flight transaction, call the cancel endpoint.

:::warning[Warning]
We do not recommend using the Disconnect API. If there is any reason to close the session, the cancel button should be pressed. Fixing this with software would require an entire development chart.
