# Read Card

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge class='small' type="post" /> P2PE/readCard](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/P2PE/readCard&branch=main&version=3.0.1)**: A call to the readCard endpoint initiates an MSR (magnetic stripe), EMV (chip),
or NFC (contactless) payment card interaction and returns a token to be used in a subsequent payment
execution using the SnapPay Charge API. The readCard endpoint does not initiate an authorization or
capture funds.
