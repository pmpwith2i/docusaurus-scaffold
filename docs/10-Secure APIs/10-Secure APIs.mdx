# Secure APIs

This section will provide detailed information required to integrate with SnapPay payment processing
solutions through Secure APIs.

The Secure APIs are designed for applications that need more complex payment flows. Different features
and functions may be called depending on the applicationâ€™s customizable payment flows. The Secure
APIs are flexible but may require a larger development effort.

:::warning[Other APIs]
Other APIs may be available on the SnapPay Developer Studio, they should not be needed for the Texas
DIR programs and are not recommended to be used.
