# Transaction History

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge type="get" /> /api/TransactionHistory](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=get&path=/api/TransactionHistory&branch=main&version=3.0.1)**: The TransactionHistory download API can report all payment transactions that have occurred on the SnapPay portal. Based on account configuration, this can include payments on the EIPP portal, as well as through the interoperability APIâ€™s. Payment information includes invoice details for a complete picture of the intended accounting of the payment. New payments since the last time the API was called are returned by default. This allows calling the API multiple times during the day and being assured that only transactions you have not already received will be returned. If a date range is provided, all transactions within that range will be reported each time the API is called.
