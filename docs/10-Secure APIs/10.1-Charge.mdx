# Charge

import ApiBadge from '@site/src/components/ApiBadge';

**[<ApiBadge type="post" /> /api/interop/v2/charge](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/api/interop/v2/charge&branch=main&version=V2)**: The Charge API performs a credit card charge or payment using a credit card token to insure the credit card is valid, has the requested credit limit available and to initiate the transfer of funds. This performs the functions of the Authorize API and Capture API in a single call.


:::tip[Tip]
We reviewed the Charge API in the Account Number Tokenizer section. However, this API can be called
independently from the Account Number Tokenizer use case.
