# USAS Requirements

Financial processing in Texas follows the Uniform State Accounting System (USAS). USAS provides both
GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and cash-basis accounting and satisfies both state and
agency accounting requirements. USAS captures accounting activities supplied by state agencies and
institutions of higher education.

Financial data in USAS is used by the Comptrollerâ€™s office to produce state payments, agency reports,
legislative reports, and reports for appropriation management and statewide budgets.

:::warning

The FDMS systems assume the correct entry of USAS data and do not provide error checking. The data
passes through to the various reporting systems.

When calling the Get Request ID API, applications that use USAS are required to pass all USAS data in
the payload for every transaction. The Get Request ID API includes sections for you to input all necessary
USAS data. We are assuming you are familiar with both USAS Header and Line data. This section will
show you how to format and pass your USAS data using the GetRequestID code snippet in Developer
Studio (screenshots below): [POST/api/interop/v2/GetRequestID](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/api/?type=post&path=/api/interop/v2/GetRequestID&branch=main&version=V2).

The **clxstream** object contains all **USAS Data**:

<img class="bordered" src='/img/3/1.png' style={{width: 400}} />

The **transaction** object contains **USAS Header Data**:

<img class="bordered" src='/img/3/2.png' style={{width: 400}} />


The **reportlinedetails** object can contain multiple lines of **USAS Data**:
Example: Line 1 (Note the pattern of USAS Attributes following the line number 1)

<img class="bordered" src='/img/3/3.png' style={{width: 400}} />


Example: Line 2 (Note the pattern of USAS Attributes following the line number 2)

<img class="bordered" src='/img/3/4.png' style={{width: 400}} />


With this class, you are ready to generate the Request ID!
