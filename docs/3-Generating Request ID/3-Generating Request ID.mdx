# Generating Request ID

Now that you have the Utility Class in your project, you will be able to generate the necessary HMAC
Signature to call the SnapPay APIs. The API we will be calling is the Get Request ID API.

:::warning

The Get Request ID API is only relevant for Hosted Payment Page and Account Number Tokenizer
Solutions.
