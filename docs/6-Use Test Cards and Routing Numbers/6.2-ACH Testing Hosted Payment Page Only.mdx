# ACH Testing (Hosted Payment Page Only)

We will be using a **Routing Number** for testing ACH Transactions. Any real routing number will work in
the test environment. We will be using our Test Routing number available in [SnapPay Developer Studio â€“
Test Data](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/SnapPay/docs/?path=docs/appendix-a-test-data.md&branch=main).

Type the **Routing Number** and any random **Account Number** (at least 4 digits long) into the necessary
fields. The other fields can also be filled with random information.

### Test ACH Details

| Routing Number | Bank Account Number |
|---|---|
| 071904779 | 123456789 |

Once you click **Submit**, you will be redirected to a new page that will show the transaction response!
