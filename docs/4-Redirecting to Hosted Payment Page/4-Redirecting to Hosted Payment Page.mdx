# Redirecting to Hosted Payment Page

Now that you have the Utility and Service Classes in your project, you will be able to redirect a user to the
Hosted Payment Page.

We are providing you with 4 code snippets below. The following snippets demonstrate how to generate
an HMAC Signature, make a request to the SnapPay API to retrieve a Request ID, and redirect the user
to the SnapPay Hosted Payment Page with the returned Request ID. This functionality can be integrated
into any Java or C# application to interact with SnapPayâ€™s API securely by generating an HMAC for
request validation and handling the response for the payment flow. These code snippets utilize the
classes we have already provided above.
