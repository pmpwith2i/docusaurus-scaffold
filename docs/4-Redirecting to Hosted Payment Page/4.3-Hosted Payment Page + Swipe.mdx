# Hosted Payment Page + Swipe

The process for Hosted Payment Page + Swipe is almost identical to the Hosted Payment Page. The only
difference is you would be passing the *device hsn* as an additional parameter in the Get Request ID API
call.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| devicehsn | *string* | Enter the devicehsn number, referring to the Card Pointe terminal device's HSN number, applicable only to Card Connect. |
